# PylibMS

PylibMS is a library built in Python 3.12+ for the libMessageStudio (LMS) proprietary file formats (`msbt`, `msbp`,
`msbf`) from Nintendo. It supports the following:

| File Format | Read | Write |  Description | Configuration Support                                                                     |
|-------------|------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MSBT        | ✅   | ✅    | Complete attribute decoding + tag decoding down to official `mstxt` Nintendo tool syntax. | |
| MSBF        | ✅   | ✅    | Flexible node + parameter decoding through configuration definitions.                     
| MSBP        | ✅   | ❌    | N/A                                                                                       |

This library is designed to support LMS revision 3.0+ from most Nintendo consoles. However, MSBF files that use `FLW1` and `FLW2` are not supported.

# Features and Usage

Simple preview of the library is below. See [the wiki](https://github.com/AbdyyEee/PylibMS/wiki) for more explanations
and examples.

## Reading

MSBT/MSBF

```py
from lms.message.msbtio import read_msbt_path
from lms.message.msbfio import read_msbf_path

msbt = read_msbt_path("Game.msbt")
msbf = read_msbf_path("Game_Flowchart.msbf")
```

## Writing

```py
from lms.message.msbtio import write_msbt_path
from lms.message.msbfio import write_msbf_path

write_msbt_path("Out_Game.msbt")
write_msbf_path("Out_Game_Flowchart.msbt")
```
